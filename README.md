work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for

David Notes from Lab: I have had previous experience with git, however I
am not used to using RStudio; so I cloned it with the terminal rather
than using the RStudio GUI at first, which caused me a bit of confusion.
Then I realized my issue when I couldn’t find the Git tab, so I instead
cloned the repository with help of my team members through RStudio
instead. After I could access the Git tab, I made the RStudio line
commit and was able to push it to the repository.
